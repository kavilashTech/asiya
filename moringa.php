                            <p>The bark, sap, roots, leaves, seeds, and flowers are used in traditional medicine.</p>
                            <p>In developing countries, moringa has the potential to improve nutrition and have been used to combat malnutrition, especially among infants and nursing mothers.</p>
                            <p>Moringa leaves are anti-inflammatory in nature due to the presence of isothiocyanates. They have niazimicin that is known to reign in the development of cancer cells. Inflammation is the root cause of many diseases like cancer, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and many autoimmune diseases. When we suffer an injury or infection, the body suffers increased inflammation.</p>
